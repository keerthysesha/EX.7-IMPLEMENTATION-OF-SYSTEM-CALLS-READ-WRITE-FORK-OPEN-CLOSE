# EX.7-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-SYSTEM-CALLS-READ-WRITE-FORK-OPEN-CLOSE

## AIM:
To write a C program using open, read, write, close , create , fork() system calls.

## THEORY:
There are 5 basic system calls that Unix provides for file I/O.

1. Create: Used to Create a new empty file
Syntax :int creat(char *filename, mode_t mode)

filename : name of the file which you want to create

mode : indicates permissions of new file.

2. Open: Used to Open the file for reading, writing or both. Syntax: int open(char *path, int flags [ , int mode ] );
Path : path to file which you want to use

flags : How you like to use

O_RDONLY: read only, O_WRONLY: write only, O_RDWR: read and write, O_CREAT: create

file if it doesn’t exist, O_EXCL: prevent creation if it already exists

3. Close: Tells the operating system you are done with a file descriptor and Close the file which pointed by fd. Syntax: int close(int fd);fd :filedescriptor

4. Read: From the file indicated by the file descriptor fd, the read() function reads cnt bytes of input into the memory area indicated by buf. A successful read() updates the access time for the file. Syntax: int read(int fd, char *buf, int size);

fd: file descripter

buf: buffer to read data from

cnt: length of buffer

5. Write: Writes cnt bytes from buf to the file or socket associated with fd. cnt should not begreater than INT_MAX (defined in the limits.h header file). If cnt is zero, write()simply returns 0without
attempting any other action.

Syntax: int write(int fd, char *buf, int size);fd: file

descripter

buf: buffer to write data to

cnt: length of buffer

*File descriptor is integer that uniquely identifies an open file of the process.
## ALGORITHM:
1.Star the program.

2.Open a file for O_RDWR for R/W,O_CREATE for creating a file ,O_TRUNC for truncate

a file.

3.Using getchar(), read the character and stored in the string[] array.

4.The string [] array is write into a file close it.

5.Then the first is opened for read only mode and read the characters and displayed it and

close the file.

6.Use Fork().

7.Stop the program.

## PROGRAM:
```c

#include<sys/stat.h>
#include<stdio.h>
#include<fcntl.h>
#include<sys/types.h>
int main()
{
int n,i=0;
int f1,f2;
char c,strin[100];
f1=open("data",O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC);
while((c=getchar())!='\n')
{
strin[i++]=c;
}
strin[i]='\0';
write(f1,strin,i);
close(f1);
f2=open("data",O_RDONLY);
read(f2,strin,0);
printf("\n%s\n",strin);
close(f2);
fork();
return 0;
}
```

## RESULT:
Thus, open, read, write, close , create , fork() system calls implemented successfully using C program.
